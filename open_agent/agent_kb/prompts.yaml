semantic_match_prompt: |
  Task : Determine if the semantic meaning of the prediction and true_answer matches.

  Input Format :
  question: [Description of the specific task]
  prediction: [Model generated output]
  true_answer: [Ground truth answer]

  Judgment Criteria :
  1. Semantic match takes precedence over literal match (allow synonyms/paraphrasing)
  2. Core information must be identical (entities/numbers/logical relationships must align)
  3. Ignore minor formatting differences (punctuation, spacing, capitalization)

  Consider false when:
  - Semantic contradictions exist
  - Information is missing/redundant
  - Precision mismatch (e.g., "2023" vs "May 2023")
  - Correct results caused by reasoning errors

  Output Requirements:
  - Strictly return plain text "true" or "false"
  - No explanations or additional content
  - Maintain strict boolean output format

  Examples:
  question: On the DeepFruits fruit detection graph on Connected Papers from 2016, what feature caused the largest bubble to be the size it is?
  prediction: citation count
  true_answer: citations
  true

  task: Calculate the result of 2+3
  prediction: five
  true_answer: 6
  false

  Now answer the task below:\n
  question: {{question}}
  prediction: {{prediction}}
  true_answer: {{true_answer}}
