- [2025.08.21] **Science-Star Init**: We release Science-Star. It is an user-friendly open platform for building, extending, and experimenting with scientific agents.

</details>

## üß† Overview

We introduce **Science-Star**, the open-source framework built to revolutionize how we build, extend, and experiment scientific AI agents. Frustrated by the limitations of existing tools, we engineered Science-Star to be intuitive yet powerful. At its core, Science-Star combines a robust **ReAct-based engine** with essential features like Planning, Action, Memory and Reflection, integrated **HLE dataset support**, and **powerful visualization tools**. It's an all-in-one platform designed to get your ideas from concept to reality, faster than ever. Whether you are a seasoned researcher or a curious developer, Science-Star provides the tools you need to push the boundaries of science. The next breakthrough is waiting. Let's build it together. Join the Science-Star community today!

## üî• Key Features

- **Integrated Visualization**: An end-to-end, extensible visualization suite powered by [streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit). It streamlines the entire workflow from data inspection and real-time experiment monitoring to results logging and analysis.

- **Plug-and-Play Modularity**: Core components (`dataloader`, `memory`, `planner`, `tool`, `evaluator`) are designed with well-defined interfaces. This modularity enables effortless substitution and customization.

- **Scientific Extensibility**: Science-Star has built-in support for advanced retrieval and literature-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## üö© Incoming Features

- **More Scientific Extensibility**: We will add more tools for seamless integration of specific scientific tools (e.g., Chemistry, Biology).

- **More Architectures Support**: We will support more agent architectures outside the ReAct framework.

- **More Tasks and Datasets Support**: We will support more agent datasets and tasks, like GAIA etc.

## üöÄ Easy Experiments

- [Environment Setup](https://github.com/Melmaphother/Science-Star/blob/main/docs/installation.md)
- [Quick Start: Try o4-mini + ReAct on HLE-Small](https://github.com/Melmaphother/Science-Star/blob/main/docs/quickstart.md)

## üõ†Ô∏è Extending Science-Star with Your Own Tools and Workflows

Additional resources are available in the codebase:

- Example tools: `science_star/tools/`
- Data preprocessing: `science_star/data_utils`
- Visualization: `visualization/vis_xx`

## üß™ Experimental Results

Using o4-mini-2025-04-16 as our base model, we have achieved **state-of-the-art (SOTA)** results on a small-scale HLE dataset by implementing an **end-to-end pipeline** that leverages the **ReAct** framework with integrated **planning, action, memory and reflection** modules. The project requires further testing and refinement. We invite the open-source community to join us in shaping the future of this work. Let's build together!
