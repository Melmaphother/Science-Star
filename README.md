<summary><b>Recent Updates</b></summary>

- [2025.08.15] **Open-Agent Init**: We release Open-Agent. It is an user-friendly open platform for building, extending, and experimenting with scientific agents.

</details>

## üß† Overview

We introduce **Science-Star**, the open-source framework built to revolutionize how we build, extend, and experiment scientific AI agents. Frustrated by the limitations of existing tools, we engineered Science-Star to be intuitive yet powerful. At its core, Science-Star combines a robust **ReAct-based engine** with essential features like Planning, RAG, integrated **HLE dataset support**, and **powerful visualization tools**. It's an all-in-one platform designed to get your ideas from concept to reality, faster than ever. Whether you are a seasoned researcher or a curious developer, Science-Star provides the tools you need to push the boundaries of science. The next breakthrough is waiting. Let's build it together. Join the Science-Star community today!

## üî• Key Features

- **Integrated Visualization**: An end-to-end, extensible visualization suite powered by [streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit). It streamlines the entire workflow from data inspection and real-time experiment monitoring to results logging and analysis.

- **Plug-and-Play Modularity**: Core components (`dataLoader`, `memory`, `planner`, `tool`, `evaluator`) are designed with well-defined interfaces. This modularity enables effortless substitution and customization.

- **Scientific Extensibility**: A dedicated adaptation layer for seamless integration of scientific tools (e.g., Chemistry, Biology). It has built-in support for advanced retrieval and literature-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
