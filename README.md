<summary><b>Recent Updates</b></summary>

- [2025.08.15] **Open-Agent Init**: We release Open-Agent. It is an user-friendly open platform for building, extending, and experimenting with scientific agents.

</details>

## üß† Overview

**Open-Agent** is an open-source framework designed to accelerate research and development at the critical intersection of **RL** and **Agent**. Our framework employs **End-to-End** reinforcement learning to train agents in specific environments. Developers need only define domain-specific tools and reward functions to extend Agent-R1 to their unique use cases, eliminating the need for complex workflow engineering. We hope our modest contribution can benefit the open-source community, making it easier for researchers and developers to create and explore agents in their own domains, collectively advancing the development of autonomous agents. For more details on the algorithm, see [algorithm doc](https://github.com/0russwest0/Agent-R1/blob/main/docs/algorithm/algorithm.md).

## üî• Key Features

- **Integrated Visualization**: An end-to-end, extensible visualization suite powered by [streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit). It streamlines the entire workflow from data inspection and real-time experiment monitoring to results logging and analysis.

- **Plug-and-Play Modularity**: Core components (`DataLoader`, `Memory`, `Planner`, `Tool`, `Evaluator`) are designed with well-defined interfaces. This modularity enables effortless substitution and customization.

- **Scientific Extensibility**: A dedicated adaptation layer for seamless integration of scientific tools (e.g., Chemistry, Biology). It has built-in support for advanced retrieval and literature-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
