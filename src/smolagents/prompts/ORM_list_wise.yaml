  Evaluation_Guidelines:
    Objective:
      description: >
        You will evaluate N candidate trajectories, each representing a series of nodes in a search tree. Each trajectory contains the following:
        - step_number: Depth of the node in the trajectory.
        - observations: Observations recorded at each step of the trajectory.
        - action_output: Direct action output at each step.
        - model_output: Raw model output (LLM).
        - error: Any errors encountered (can be None).
        - previous_steps: The history of earlier steps, including TaskStep and PlanningStep, with the trajectory of ActionSteps leading to the current state.
      goal: >
        Your goal is to evaluate each trajectory holistically, considering how well it progresses toward solving the user's task. Select the trajectory that most effectively achieves this goal.
  
    Evaluation_Criteria:
      Progress_Toward_Goal:
        description: >
          Assess how well each trajectory advances the task at hand, considering both the individual node's progress and the overall progression of the entire trajectory.
        key_points:
          - Reward trajectories that demonstrate tangible and meaningful progress toward the goal.
          - Penalize trajectories with weak actions or minimal/no advancement.
  
      Trajectory_Efficiency:
        description: >
          Evaluate how efficiently each trajectory progresses toward the goal, considering the depth and complexity of the steps.
        key_points:
          - Favor trajectories that achieve significant progress with fewer steps.
          - Consider the overall value-to-depth ratio when comparing trajectories of different lengths.
          - Reward efficient exploration of the search space.
  
      Loop_Detection:
        description: >
          Detect loops or repetitions within each trajectory, especially those related to previous steps.
        loop_types:
          - Real Loops: Identical nodes (observations, action output, and model output) that do not add value to the trajectory.
          - Benign Repetitions: Similar strategies with variations yielding additional progress.
        key_points:
          - Heavily penalize trajectories with real loops.
          - Slight penalties for benign repetitions if they lead to meaningful improvements.
  
      Error_and_Stability:
        description: >
          Evaluate the severity of errors encountered in each trajectory and penalize based on their impact on progression.
        error_severity:
          - Fatal/Blocking Errors: Major penalty.
          - Significant Errors: Moderate penalty.
          - Minor/Recoverable Issues: Minor penalty.
        key_points:
          - Penalize unstable or unclear model outputs.
          - Consider how errors affect the overall trajectory's ability to move toward the goal.
  
      Overall_Trajectory_Quality:
        description: >
          Evaluate the coherence and overall quality of the trajectory.
        key_points:
          - Consider the logical sequence of steps and the exploration-exploitation balance.
          - Evaluate the final node's closeness to achieving the goal.
          - Reward trajectories that make consistent progress and demonstrate coherent planning.
  
    Evaluation_Variables:
      description: >

          description: "The efficiency of the trajectory in terms of the number of steps and exploration depth."
          score_range: "0-10"
        - dimension_name: "Loop Detection"
          description: "The number and severity of loops detected in the trajectory."
          score_range: "0-10"
        - dimension_name: "Error Severity"
          description: "The severity of errors in the trajectory and their impact on progression."

          description: "The overall quality of the trajectory, including its logical flow and consistency."
          score_range: "0-10"
  
    Final_Output_Format:
      description: >
        Provide your evaluation in the following JSON format. Select the best trajectory and provide a detailed analysis explaining why it is the most promising trajectory.
      output_format:
